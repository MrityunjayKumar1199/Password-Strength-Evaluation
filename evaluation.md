# Cyber Security Internship Task 6 - Password Strength Evaluation

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and evaluate it manually using best practices.

---

## Step 1: Passwords Created

| Password | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| password123 | Simple, common, weak |
| P@ssword2025 | Moderate, mixed characters |
| G$7r!vL9kQ@2 | Strong, complex, hard to guess |
| CorrectHorseBatteryStaple! | Passphrase, long & memorable |

---

## Step 2: Password Strength Evaluation

**Scoring Criteria:**  
- Length ≥12 → +2  
- Uppercase letters → +1  
- Lowercase letters → +1  
- Numbers → +1  
- Symbols → +2  
- No dictionary words → +2  
- No personal info → +1  

| Password | Score | Strength | Notes |
|----------|-------|---------|-------|
| password123 | 4/9 | Weak | Short, common, dictionary word |
| P@ssword2025 | 7/9 | Moderate | Good mix, slightly predictable |
| G$7r!vL9kQ@2 | 10/9 | Strong | Very complex, hard to guess |
| CorrectHorseBatteryStaple! | 9/9 | Strong | Long passphrase, easy to remember, hard to crack |

## Step 3: Observations

- **Length matters:** Longer passwords are exponentially harder to brute-force.  
- **Mix characters:** Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increase strength.  
- **Avoid dictionary words:** Makes dictionary attacks ineffective.  
- **Use passphrases:** Memorable and secure.  
- **Avoid personal info:** Protects against guessing and social engineering.

## Step 4: Common Password Attacks

1. **Brute-force attack:** Tries all possible combinations until it finds the password.  
2. **Dictionary attack:** Uses common words and leaked passwords.  
3. **Credential stuffing:** Reuses leaked passwords from other accounts.  
4. **Phishing:** Tricks users into revealing passwords.  

**Conclusion:** Password complexity, length, and unpredictability significantly increase security.

## Step 5: Best Practices

- Use **long passwords** or **passphrases** (12+ characters).  
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.  
- Avoid **common words, repeated characters, or personal info**.  
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** whenever possible.  
- Use a **password manager** to store unique passwords safely.
