## Steps Completed

1. **Created Multiple Passwords**  
   - Simple: `password123`  
   - Moderate: `P@ssword2025`  
   - Strong: `G$7r!vL9kQ@2`  
   - Passphrase: `CorrectHorseBatteryStaple!`  

2. **Evaluated Password Strength Manually**  
   - Used a scoring system based on length, character variety, dictionary words, and personal info.  
   - Assigned scores and categorized strength as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.  

3. **Documented Observations**  
   - Long passwords and mixed characters are stronger.  
   - Dictionary words and personal info make passwords weak.  
   - Passphrases improve memorability and security.  

4. **Researched Common Password Attacks**  
   - Brute-force attack  
   - Dictionary attack  
   - Credential stuffing  
   - Phishing  

5. **Summarized Best Practices**  
   - Use long passwords (12+ characters)  
   - Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols  
   - Avoid common words or personal info  
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
   - Use a password manager for safe storage
